            Also, pipelining where several resourcescan be reuqested at once from server,
            but it was hard to impliment due to Head-Of-Line Blocking issues.

            be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time. 
            It is done using streams which can be prioritized, can have dependencies and individual
            flow control.
            It also provides "Server Push" that send data priorily although client has not yet requested.

                status of a message. Can define 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker 
                and more efficient.</td>

                the resources are already present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.</td>

            <td>Though security is still not mandatory, it is mostly encrypted (though it is not enforced) since almost all clients require traffic to be encrypted. It also has some minimum standards, 
                such as minimum key size for encryption. TLS 1.2 etc.</td>

            <td>WEB TRAFFIC</td>
            <td>HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0.
                 However, TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding (resources can be downloaded simultaneously 
                 by using multiple domains),
                 connection reuse and pipelining, there is an increased risk of network congestion.</td>
            <td>HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater
                 margin along with being less sensitive to network delays.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>HEADER COMPRESSION</td>
            <td>Headers are sent on every request leading to a lot of duplicate data being sent uncompressed across the wire. </td>
            <td>Header compression is included by default in HTTP/2 using HPACK.</td>
